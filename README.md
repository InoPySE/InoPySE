> **Tech is my escape from a world full of nonsense.**  
> I’m not here to entertain the ignorance around me, I’m here to create the future.

## 🔧 Technologies I'm Learning:
- **Languages:** Python, HTML
- **Not Yet:** CSS, JavaScript (Still in the "I can do this!" phase)

---

## 🧠 About Me:
- I'm just a student trying to break out of a system that values everything but logic.
- Currently, I’m learning programming and exploring what it means to create meaningful software.
- I don't have finished projects yet, but that's because I'm **building foundations**, not show-off work.
- I’m sick of the *toxic* environment of my school, where “anarchy” reigns, and where everything is about **feudalism**, **ethnocentrism**, and **primordialism**. I’m just here to survive, learn, and hopefully create something better one day.

## 💬 On School and Society:
In a world where the loudest voices are often the dumbest, it’s hard to focus on learning.  
Here’s a little truth about my reality:  
- **Anarchy** – Some people think they can break rules just because they *can*, and they somehow get praised for it.  
- **Feudalism** – The so-called "leaders" are just puppets with no real vision, and everyone else is stuck bowing down.  
- **Ethnocentrism** – They think their culture is the only one that matters, and they judge others based on outdated ideas.  
- **Primordialism** – They cling to outdated tribal mentalities and treat differences like weaknesses.  

I'm tired of this. That's why I choose to learn and focus on my future, no matter how messed up the environment is.

## 🔮 My Future Goals:
- Be an **AI Engineer**.
- Learn all the things I should have learned in a *functional* educational system.
- Use tech to **bring balance**, even when the world around me is just one big mess.
