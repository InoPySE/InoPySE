## 🧠 About Me
- A curious student focused on building strong programming foundations.

- I'm determined to rise above systems that often prioritize form over function and appearances over substance.

## 🌍 Reflections on School and Society
Learning isn't always easy in an environment where values often clash with reason.  
Here are a few realities I observe around me:

- **Rule-Bending Culture** – Some are celebrated despite disregarding structure and fairness.
- **Hierarchy Overload** – Student leadership often becomes symbolic, without real space to lead or inspire.
- **Cultural Bias** – Traditional norms are often imposed without room for diversity or growth.
- **Outdated Thinking** – Progress is slowed when differences are seen as threats instead of strengths.

These challenges push me to learn with intention—to one day build systems and solutions that are inclusive, balanced, and smart.

## 🔮 Goals and Aspirations
- Become a professional **AI Engineer**.
- Relearn what I should’ve been taught in a more functional and empowering educational system.
- Use tech to bring logic, clarity, and purpose to communities in need of change.
